  introduction: `The Institute has been educating India’s computing professionals for the past two decades as
    various academic programs have been offered from its inception. The undergraduate
    programme in Computer Science and Engineering was started in 2017. Following the creation of
    departments in the Institute, the department of Computer Science and Engineering was
    established in August 2022. Along with the UG programme, the department offers a
    postgraduate programme in the field of Information Security. The students are encouraged to
    carry out projects in niche areas including Information Systems, Computer Vision, Computer
    Networks and Software Engineering, as well as specializations in emerging areas of importance
    such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, machine learning and data analytics.<br>
    The department has a mix of young and experienced senior faculty members specializing in a
    wide spectrum of research and teaching areas. The department is in the process of developing
    state-of-the-art laboratories to cater to the needs of the curriculum. Although at its nascent
    stage, the department is rapidly evolving to both industrial and academic requirements.
    Consequently, the department attracts brilliant students who are industry-ready at the end of
    their respective programmes.`,
  vision: `Global excellence in Computer Science and Engineering education and research as a valuable
    resource for industry and society adapting to the demands of the persistently changing digital
    world.`,
  mission: [
    `To provide in-depth knowledge through effective pedagogies and practical exposure using the
        latest tools and technologies in the discipline of computer science and engineering.`,
    `To advance academics by performing state-of-the-art research and providing industry-
        oriented undergraduate and postgraduate programs in the discipline of computer science and
        engineering.`,
    `To nourish and imbibe human values and excellence, equipping young minds to utilize their
        creativity and passion in serving the global community’s needs.`,
